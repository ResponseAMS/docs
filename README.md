# Documentation

This repository holds the documentation for the ResponseAMS documentation. The documentation
files are held within the `docs` folder and we're happy to accept pull requests for edits and
suggested new content.

In general, you should feel welcome to make the necessary changes and ccreate your pull request
from a feature branch. We will not merge any pull requests that are based on your `master` branch
for the sake of keeping merge conflicts to a minimum.

## Contributing

Response documentation should be written with the following things in mind:

- Assume no prior experience with the platform.
- Write documentation in English. In the future the project may support additional languages in the documentaiton,
  however, for now please stick to English.
- Write documentation like you're explaining it to a friend. Avoid the technical jargon and write it as an ordinary person
  would speak it, so everyone can understand it.
- Follow organizational patterns already in place. We are willing to accept change to the formatting of the documentation,
  however please do not make organizational changes without consent from a Core team member first.
- Use documentation features to emphasize pieces of your documentation and ensure readers are able to fully understand the
  concepts being discussed.

### Markdown Features

You can find all of the Markdown features in the [Stoplight Studio documentation](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/studio/docs/Documentation/01-getting-started.md)
where they discuss all of the ins-and-outs of the documentation and markdown engines, paying special care of the
`Stoplight Flavored Markdown` section allow you to use things like callouts, code blocks, tables, tabs, HTTP Request Maker's
and much more.

## License

The documentation is MIT-licensed. You're free to copy the documentation and make your own if you wish, though we'd appreciate
it if you would instead contibute back to help the community.
