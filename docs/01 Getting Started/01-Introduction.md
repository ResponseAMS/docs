# Introduction

Welcome to Response, an open source CAD, MDT, RMS, and agency management system with a simple goal of providing
a fully-featured platform with the ability to easily theme and extend it to add functionality not available in
the core of the project. To do this, Response implements a simple theming and module system, each working independently of each other as separate entities in Response.

The **Response Marketplace**, which is currently being developed, offers a simple way for you to install community-created themes and extensions so that members of the community can add additional functionality to
Response as a platform.

To continue and get started installing response, check out the platform requirements in the next section.
